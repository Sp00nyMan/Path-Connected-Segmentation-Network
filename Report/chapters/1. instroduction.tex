\section{Introduction}

The domain of image segmentation has witnessed significant advancements thanks to the utilization of deep learning techniques.
Deep learning provides a powerful approach to effectively capture and understand the underlying connections within the training data,
thereby generating high-quality segmentation masks across a wide range of datasets.
However, it is important to acknowledge that deep neural networks, such as fully-connected and convolutional neural networks,
are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and noise. This susceptibility can result in unexpected behavior and
subsequently lead to inaccurate segmentation masks.

To overcome this challenge and ensure the reliability of segmentation models, it is possible to impose certain constraints on the model's function,
which is represented by the machine learning algorithm used for image segmentation.

In this paper, we introduce a new technique that guarantees the path connectedness of the obtained decision space,
thereby improving the accuracy and consistency of the segmentation process.
This technique aims to address the issue of adversarial attacks and noise by enforcing mathematical properties of the segmentation model,
promoting more robust and interpretable results.
