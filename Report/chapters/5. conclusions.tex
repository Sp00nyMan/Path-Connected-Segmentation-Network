\section{Conclusions}

We have developed a machine learning technique that enables the accurate
segmentation of images at a per-pixel level.
This approach has been extensively analyzed, and through mathematical proofs,
we have demonstrated that the decision space resulting from this technique
is path-connected. By imposing mathematical constraints on the network,
we are able to enhance the interpretability of the model's output and increase
its resilience against noise interference.
We further aim to expand the application of this method to a wider range of tasks
in order to create a more generalized model.
Additionally, we are keen on conducting further investigations to gain deeper
insights into the behavior of the model.
